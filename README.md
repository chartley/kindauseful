Kinda Useful - hijacking your procrastination for good.

This Chrome Extension looks at the current URL as you browse, and if it's a time-wasting site suggests you do one of the tasks you've got on your personal to-do list, giving your brain a rest and also getting something kinda useful done.

Background
----------

We all need a break sometimes, and our fingers are trained to type in "9gag.com" before we even realize it. We don't need to waste this time though, simply do somthing easy to give our brains a bit of a rest from whatever taxing thing it was doing. So instead of looking at more inane stuff on 9gag, you can order those flowers for mum / return that call you missed / book that appointment to donate blood.


Installation
------------

This isn't in the Chrome web store yet, so you need to

* download a copy of the files in this repo
* [load the extension in chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)
* visit a time-wasting site, eg 9gag.com
